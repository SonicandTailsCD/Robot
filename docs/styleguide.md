Guide For Contributing to This Documentation
--------------------------------------------

This documentation is meant to be explanatory. Please explain how to do things, and break it down into reasonable chunks.

Formatting
----------

!!! important

    Please use **two spaces** to indent, not tabs.

Titles should be capitalized in the standard titling format. For example,

  * Guide For Contributing to This Documentation

Essentially, capitalize everything but unimportant words.

Please use equals and dash underlines, instead of `#` and `##`. For h3 and lower, `###` etc. is fine. The source of this file contains an example for equals and dash underlining. Equals underlines create h1 text, and dash underlines create h2 text.
